### Executive Summary
The usability evaluation assessed the CRM prototype using a moderated
think-aloud approach. Participants generally found the navigation intuitive
and task flows logical, particularly for lead creation and assignment
management. Some confusion occurred when modifying client settings, indicating
a need for clearer labeling and system feedback. Overall, the test validated
the core layout while identifying opportunities for refinement.
