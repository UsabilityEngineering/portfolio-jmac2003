### Usability Test Protocol

### Executive Summary
The usability evaluation assessed the CRM prototype using a moderated
think-aloud approach. Participants generally found the navigation intuitive
and task flows logical, particularly for lead creation and assignment
management. Some confusion occurred when modifying client settings, indicating
a need for clearer labeling and system feedback. Overall, the test validated
the core layout while identifying opportunities for refinement.

## Full Report

### Methods
This study used a formative usability evaluation with a moderated think-aloud
protocol. Tasks were designed to reflect realistic CRM workflows, allowing
observation of navigation clarity, task efficiency, and user expectations.

Each task evaluated a different UX component, including learnability,
findability, and system feedback.

### Findings
Participants completed most tasks successfully with minimal assistance.
Quantitative ratings indicated high perceived ease of use, while qualitative
feedback highlighted confusion around settings-related actions.

### Conclusions
**Recommended Improvements**
- Add confirmation feedback after modifying client settings
- Improve labeling clarity for notification controls

**Affirmed Design Decisions**
- Dashboard layout and navigation structure
- Lead creation workflow

### Caveats
This study was conducted with a small participant sample as a result of this, most of our users lacked industry specific knowledge on terminology that would've allowed them to finish task faster and have an overall greater satisfaction with the protocol.
