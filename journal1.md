## Goal

For this UX journal, I looked at our CRM **prototype** from the point of view of someone visiting the site for the first time.  
My main goal was simple:

> Can a new user understand what the site does and figure out how to sign up on their own?

I walked through each page just like a new visitor would, noticing what felt clear and what could be improved.

## Step-by-Step Experience

### 1. Home Page
The first page looks clean and simple.  
The big title **“Manage Your Clients Smarter”** quickly tells me what the site is for.  
The buttons like **Get Started** and **Sign Up** stand out and clearly show what to do next.  
This shows good **affordance**, meaning the buttons look clickable and invite action.

### 2. About Page
When I clicked **About**, it explained what the CRM tool helps with — like keeping track of clients and sending automated reminders.  
This gives the user confidence that they’re in the right place.  
That’s called **information scent**, which means the design gives clues that guide users toward their goal.

### 3. Sign In Page

Clicking **Sign In** shows a short form asking for an email and password.  
It’s very simple, which is good for returning users.  
But if I didn’t have an account yet, I’d know I need to go back and click **Sign Up** instead.  
This part fits a **heuristic evaluation** idea — meaning it follows a good usability rule: “Make the next step clear.”

### 4. Sign Up Page

*Figure 4: The sign-up form for new users.*

The **Sign Up** page lets users choose if they are a **Client** or a **Business Owner**.  
Then they can fill in basic info like name and email.  
The layout feels familiar, which matches users’ **mental model** — the way people expect sign-up forms to look based on other websites they’ve used.

---

## What Works Well
- The navigation bar is simple and easy to follow.  
- The **Sign Up** button stands out in blue.  
- The forms are short and clear.  
- The pages load in a logical order — home → about → sign in → sign up.

Overall, this is a good early design. From a **formative evaluation** (an early test to find improvements), the flow works well for a first-time visitor.

---

## What Could Be Improved
- The sign-up page could explain the difference between **Client** and **Business Owner** so users don’t have to guess.  
- It could also show what happens *after* signing up — for example, “You’ll be taken to your dashboard to manage contacts.”  
- Adding short benefit points near the form (like “Save time, track clients easily”) would keep users motivated to finish signing up.

Later on, a **summative evaluation** (testing after improvements) could check how real users perform these tasks.

- **Affordance:** When a design looks like how you use it (buttons that look clickable).  
- **Information scent:** Clues that tell users they’re in the right place.  
- **Heuristic evaluation:** Checking if a design follows good usability rules.  
- **Mental model:** What people already expect from past experiences.  
- **Formative evaluation:** Early testing to make improvements.  
- **Summative evaluation:** Testing at the end to see if everything works well.
